Description

目前，汽车的能源主要有油类燃料动力（包括汽油、柴油）、电动力两种。现在定义四个类：

1. Car类，包括静态整型数据成员cntOfCars，用于记录产生的汽车对象的个数。一个double型属性，表示汽车的速度。定义其构造函数，其中输出信息见样例。定义setSpeed(double)方法用于设置汽车的速度。

2. OilCar类，是Car类的子类，包括静态整型数据成员cntOfOilCars，记录产生的燃油动力汽车对象的个数。一个double类型的属性，表示汽车百公里油耗。定义其构造函数，其中输出信息见样例。定义show()方法，用于输出如样例所示的信息。定义setOil(double)方法，用于设置汽车的油耗。

3. ElecCar类，是Car类的子类，包括静态整型数据成员cntOfElecCars，记录产生的电动力汽车对象的个数。一个double类型的属性，表示汽车百公里能耗（以KW为单位）。定义其构造和析构函数，其中输出信息见样例。定义show()方法，用于输出如样例所示的信息。定义setPower(double)方法，用于设置汽车的能耗。

4. CarHall类，用于展示上述两类汽车。所以它应该是OilCar和ElecCar类的组合类，包含1个OilCar类的对象数组，1个ElecCar类的对象数组，每个数组的长度均为10。定义getInfo()方法，用于从标准输入中获取汽车的各种信息；定义showInfo()信息，按照样例的格式输出所有汽车的信息。
Input

输入有多行。

第1行是一个正整数M，表示之后有M行输入，0<M<21。

之后的每行输入包括3部分：第1个是一个字符，之后是2个double类型的值。

如果第1个字符是'o'，则表示之后的两个值是一辆燃油动力汽车的速度和油耗。

如果第1个字符是'e'，则表示之后的两个值是一辆电动力汽车的速度和能耗。

其他字符则不是一辆合法的汽车。
Output

见样例。
