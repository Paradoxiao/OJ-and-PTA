Description

定义一个Point类和Circle类，用于判断给定的一系列的点是否在给定的圆内。

其中，Point类：

1.有2个成员x和y，分别为其横坐标和纵坐标；1个静态成员numOfPoints，用于计算生成的点的个数。

2.具有构造函数、析构函数和拷贝构造函数，具体格式输出根据样例自行判断。

3. 具有静态方法int getNumOfPoints()，用于返回numOfPoints的值。

4. 具有int getX()和int getY()方法，用于获取横坐标和纵坐标。

Circle类：

1. 拥有Point类的对象center，表示圆心坐标。拥有radius对象，表示圆的半径；1个静态成员numOfCircles，用于指示生成了多少个圆对象。

2. 具有构造函数、析构函数和拷贝构造函数，具体格式根据样例自行判断。

3.具有静态方法int getNumOfCircles()，返回numOfCircles的值。

4. 具有getCenter()方法，返回圆心坐标。注意：根据输出结果判断返回值类型。

5. 具有bool pointInCircle(Point &)方法，用于判断给定的点是否在当前圆内。是则返回true，否则返回false。

Input

输入分多行。

第一行M>0，表示有M个测试用例。

每个测试用例又包括多行。第1行包含3个整数，分别为一个圆的横坐标、纵坐标和半径。第2行N>0，表示之后又N个点，每个点占一行，分别为其横坐标和纵坐标。

所有输入均为整数，且在int类型范围内。

Output

输出见样例。注意：在圆的边上的点，不在圆内。
